🧠 Concepts Covered

This project covers the following important React concepts:

1️⃣ Functional Components

The entire application is built using a functional component instead of class components.

2️⃣ useState Hook

The useState hook is used to store and update the counter value.

3️⃣ State Management

The counter value is stored inside a state variable. When the state updates, React re-renders the component automatically.

4️⃣ Event Handling

Button click events are handled using the onClick attribute.

5️⃣ Conditional Styling

The counter number changes color dynamically:

Green → Positive values

Red → Negative values

Black → Zero

6️⃣ CSS Styling
